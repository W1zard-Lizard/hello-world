	<h1>Still Not Hooked?</h1>
		<p>The word "El" in the title <i>"El Dorado"</i> is just one letter away from creating the word "Eel" but i assume the person behind it all wouldn't have wanted to spoil the theory behind <i> El Dorado</i>. Or else it would have been too easy and thus defeat the purpose of this page. </p> 
	<p>If you didn't already know, eel is a type of fish...What a coincidence right? </p>
	<p>I think i've made my point here. But when discussing with my homie Chris K he sent me a screenshot that Dorado is a constellation. hmm...what is this dorado then?</p>
	<p>Point is, we should be more than curious if not suspicious of the information we are given. It would be very uncanny if we didn't put questions into play. Dorado is more than just a kids animation film. It is above us, below us and as well infront of us. Dorado is a certain breed of fish. <a href="https://castandspear.com/dorado-fish/">This links you to where you can find the Dorado fish. The link also gives careful steps on how to capture them which i dont recommend.</a> So that's my proof of Dorado being a fish solved to you. Now heres a link that is from wiki, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Dorado">List of stars in Dorado</a>  Therefore, like i said before, Dorado is also up in the sky. In essence it is both below and above us. Is Dorado really just the name of a film or a fish or a star...He is a God.</p>   
		<h1>Dorado is suddnely like the day and night. The day turns into the night as well the night into day. Dorado is more than whats below the sea and as well above the sea and us essentially. I wouldn't have been to able to consider this if hadn't I plugged into Peter Frampton's famous track, "Baby, I love Your Way" which is a cover from <i>Big Mountain</i>. This song opened my third sense which is to look <i>beneath the surface</i> of things. This means to question and let that curiousity explode into a task of maybe AMBITION. Heck while you're at it, why not open up some texts of Sigmud Freud.</h1>

		<p>Suddnely it is like the day and night. The night becomes the day and the day becomes the night. Dorado is underneath us and above us. Maybe it's God,... but it is definelty not 
		<b>just a kids animation</b>. Disney is very smart for doing this, creating a film that is clearly based on iperiliasm which i think the screenwriter wanted us to consider. Especially with its title, it shows that there is more to this film but a message. I dont know what the message is because i have not watched this movie in my recent years, but <b> Chris K</b> did. So ask him. He's on Tinder, Bumblebee, and Craigslist. I love this guy.  I wouldn't have been to able to consider this <i>Dorado theory</i> if hadn't he mentioned to me the latest movie he wathed while sitting on his couch with his roommates. </p>
		<p>After this convo with the awesome Chris K, i plugged into Peter Frampton's famous track,  "Baby, I love Your Way". Peter's angelic voice took me away, which was to sink in-to the twin size mattress of my beneath-the-border-of-bedstuy-bushwick-room that i was renting.Also weird fact, this twin size mattress was there before i even started to rent the room i was living in.</p>

	<h3>This is the <b> Dorado Project</b> and it is my goal to spread the message of what really lies beneath the surface of reality. Dorado is not just a movie my friends but a speculation to bring forth</h3>
